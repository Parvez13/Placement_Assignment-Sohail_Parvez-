"I am extremely moved by Dr. Shashi Tharoor's appealing book How British looted 45 trillion from India which certainly stands as an outstanding work of exceptional quality. The book's content is truly amazing and I extensively enjoyed reading it. Many people appreciate the effort and hard work that went into the book. In addition, the Union Public Service Commission issued an outstanding report titled How the British killed 1.8 billion Indians. A Chronology of the British Raj's Exploitative Policies"
"Pooja mehta is to be commended, incredibly brave reporting"
Can't imagine happening in 2023... Government should be accountable.
I am impressed how so many people are obsessed with overcrowded local trains rather than praying for those affected. This is an express train where people without reservations aren't allowed and the accident happened due to faulty traffic control.
"God bless the lost souls and, hopefully they find the root cause asap and hold the people who are accountable, and strict action should be taken against them."
"Accident proof instruments are to be ensured. Three train, s involvement in one incident is not acceptable."
To all the families who lost their loved ones  and i didn't know India has a President.
All at the wrong place at the wrong time Jesus I hate to see it 200 people dead is a lot it's just so upsetting
sad for the victims and their families.
Kolkata to chennai route is always over over packed...
"Our rail lines are running in overcapacity. My dad was a railway controller and he said that the east coast line runs at 130% above capacity. Too much trains, too less rail lines, severly understaffed railway, safety measures flouted daily. The authority should come to practical sence now atleast."
Praying for all from Bhutan.
Rest in peace all dead peoples and get well soon all the injured peoples.
Oh no. What caused this accident?   Rip  Ô∏è and  to the families
Painful. Its a pity we still dont have advanced signalling systems !
Rest in peace Ô∏è
How did this happened? Still cant believe this.why the track was not inspected before train's arrival? GOD this is tragic
"All started to give full professional comments with the thinking of fully knowledge of causes for this tragedies incident.

Still properly investigating yet to start, but our fellow intellectual forming their opinions."
Very sad events that probably never happened in history...
"The Railways have supposed to have used GPS and collusion alert technologies on all trains. When there is one derailment,  it was claimed all trains on the route would be automatically alerted. What the hell is this? Where is the PM ? What is his answer to the 300 lives ?"
Poor Railway Administration and the Ministry of Indian Railways..upgrade is needed in Railway communications..
"Condolences from Pakistan. This is a terrible tragedy and unbearable loss to countless families. I can't even start to imagine the pain. This should remind the Indian leadership, to stop focusing on hatred, instilling religious animosities and focus on improving their transportation and other systems. Instead of spending billions of dollars on parliament, if they had spent in upgrading their Train communication and Rail systems - perhaps this tragic loss could have avoided."
Wondering how the collision detection system didn't kick in...or is it still not installed in all the trains? Or did the crash happen in real time?
PRAYING for EVERYONE IN JESUS NAME 
"In a democratic country like India, after such a terrible accident, the resignation of the railway minister  can solve everything."
"One question. Was it a head on collision or did one train slid off it‚Äôs track and hit the other train which was moving? If it was a headon collision, the responsibility goes on the ones who had to change the track. One thing is for sure, there was something wrong with one of the tracks.  "
Very sad
My deep condolences to the bereaved families.  The loss of life is immeasurable and a great tragedy to one and all. Let us pray God for the affected people's speedy recovery.
"We need to modernize our railway system, to prevent such accidents, along with passenger experience, rather than developing bullet train infra, which doesnt have use cases in India with lower flight tickets."
"They don‚Äôt know who they owe their life to, nor why they have to die"
"As many Bangladeshi people take medical treatments in Tamilnadu,  they use those trains, prayers for all."
Rip 
"The damage were 3time more if it was bullet train
Focus on present trains and modifies them instead of running of bullet train and hyperloop"
Oh my god.Its painful to listen . kindly help injured people to speedy recovery 
God bless India
"even after 75 years of Independence, govt is struggling to build a safe commute for people. But their promises are sky-high during the election campaign. so true that empty vessels make much noise."
This is not due to signalling problem but its becuz of derailment & train coming from other side on another track crashed on it
"Condolences RIP Om Shanti

New Parliament Building opened in an Inauspicious day.  The Sengol is being bended in Modi Government."
My deep condolences to the people of india from üá±üá∞üá±üá∞
Very. Sad. News. For. Odisha
This feels like a conspiracy. The level of technology used this kind of accident is impossible

"Still now there isn't a detail report regarding what failure and whose negligence caused this tragic incident. If people keep electing uneducated counsellers to ministers and who vote for money and freebies, the country's development will halt and remain like this forever."
deep condolence from Pakistan 
"We, taxpayers, want to know what measures have been taken against those railway employees who killed so many common citizens."
No one will take responsibility of this incident...
"I am thoroughly impressed with Dr. Shashi Tharoor's fascinating book titled How British looted 45 trillion from India which is simply a high quality masterpiece. The content of the book is truly amazing, and I enjoyed reading it immensely. The effort and hard work put into the book are greatly appreciated by many.

"Amazing, The German Cartoonist was right all along with his depiction of India's trains a few weeks ago."
""
"I knew it, we all see the videos of them climbing on all over the roof, hanging on the side of the door, even sitting on the drivers window and obstructing his view of passage."
It‚Äôs Really SAD . Heart Broken . My all Sympathy is and will all Families .
"sandeeeep, mandeeepp, and dephard are all investigating the incident"

May all the departed souls get justice on all those involved
Careful! Check train always

Wow this is truly tragic!!! May God have mercy on his people!!!
"If Indian Railways and Modi focused on train security instead of monthly inaugurations of vande Bharath 
the lives would have been saved"
Hayy God bless everyone pls 
Just shocking. Condolences to the families of the loved ones they lost.  
God help them
It's so sad and painful. But how do you expect the driver to see when people are hanging and sitting outside his window?
Dam rest in peace to those lost and to those injured may they have swift recovery
No one saw this coming. Where are the warning instruments? This is 2023 over crowding add to the to the high dead toll RIP 
May god save those injured people 
Technology can help in this matter..like we should have a IOT device with integrated monitoring system can help ...
Sad very sad news. RIP prayers to the innocent tavellers perished in this tragic train accident.
Hats off for Modi's strategy of privatisation.
Sack railway minister shame on him to occupy the post 
The heart is deeply saddened by this sudden and tragic tragedy. May Allah give courage & strength to those whose loved ones loss there life & speedy recovery to those who are injured.
Sad day for the IRS people
it‚Äôs very sad moment for india. we are pray to safe all people.
"Indian's cannot be angry anymore over the German's cartoonist Ji's depiction of their trains. 
He must be smiling, laughing thrilled right now. What a legend he is."
Rip
"Condolences to the families of the victims.
If this is due to a human error, it should not pass."

Death will be increased 600+ that coming   news from the ground local it's more than that
What's more pathetic is few locals are looting wounded passengers in between rescue
"India can deliver 100 satellites into orbit, but cannot ensure technology to avoid such unfortunate accidents."
"Why vandebharath,, first we need good signal system"
"Its ""Made in India""..enough said"
"In Japan and South Korea and China those ""in charge"" are fired and almost certainly go to jail and then the cause of such a disaster is researched and REMEDIED TO NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN......

MEANWHILE: in ""incredible superpower india"" ""the victims are ""compensated"" WHILE THE CAUSES FOR THE DISASTER ARE IGNORED/OVERLOOKED LEADING TO ANOTHER DISASTER......"
This is the safety of LHB coaches?
So there was 3 trains that crashed in to each other??? Wtf!!! Negligence much?
Many dumb viewers are talking abt Overcapacity of the train when the accident occurred to due inefficiency of railway department for overlooking the railway routes and tracks and not warning the trains abt the other trains that are passing in that route
what is the cause of the accident? is it the negligence of railways??? if so how they will run Bullet trains in India??
"Painful  and praying ,but Q? Arises how it happened, has our  system lacunae. ERROR SHOULD BE RECTIFIED"
Om Shanti Ô∏è
Its the mistake of train traffic control
Let the Railway Minister Resign in shame. Jumla govt has only Jumla ministers.
Modi is interested in doing antics every day so that his photo will be there in the front pages of news papers. Why can't he visit the accident site in the same spirit as he flags off Vandhe Bharat trains?
So sad
"200000 rupees actually,not200000 dollars!"
They are busy in new vande Bharath express forgot the railway maintenance
"Dear PM, we don't want Vande bharat kind of trains, we want what we have in good condition and safe. Thanks"
Too fast!
Horrible... RIP... Should we still think of Vandhe bharath trains with such infrastructure in place...
How vulnerable Indian railway system is & how corrupt railway minister is the proof of this tragic accident. How shamelessly ashini vaishnav is holding its post even after killing so many innocent lives.
This is what will happen when you give jobs on reservation not on Merit.
When will railway minister resign ?
Thorough investigation is required to rule out sabotage
oh no!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ambani‚Äôs money is now ongoing mode‚Ä¶!
This could be a sabotage.
Wah modi ji wah
Bangalore howrah express to Karnataka ka train hai to tamilnadu ki baat kyu ho Rahi hai
1:27 Whaaaaaaa
"who is going to take  responsibility? employees? officers? RAILWAY MINISTER.. OR HIS ..... ALL IN ALL ... HOME MINISTER OR ABOVE ALL PM... Or just pass it on signal failures or poor drivers and gaurds... no moral ground after coming to power by so called noncongress central govt., is it correct.?"
I'm just remembering German Cartoon.
Rest in peace.. Jai Jagannath
Now the wion woke up from a deep sleep

"RIP
 India need China train."
"I feel sorry for India. In a heartbreaking report released on Tuesday, The Hindu India's state news, revealed that India's standing on the Global Hunger Index is a devastating 107 out of 121 countries. Tragically, India fares even worse than every single country in South Asia, including its neighboring nation Pakistan and even the war-torn Afghanistan. This distressing news underscores the grave extent of hunger and food insecurity gripping India, leaving a somber cloud over the nation."
Hallelujah hallelujah
Present government is not investing anything on railways.
"My parayer to those who lost their lives and injured and the families.

Now is not like in the past.
Live tracking is available."
This is the reason why I didn't receive calls from the IRS scammers?? Makes sense
Om Mani Pedmi Hum/ Rest in Peace.
This is the consequence of electing illiterate prime minister
Jesus
This is not accident
"Train in INDIA., NOT GOOD "
This is look like sabotage and need to be investigated.
"Rest in peace. Fortunately, India does not have bullet train incidents; otherwise, the death toll would be much higher!"
Normal day in india
Kiski galti se hua
India is the most populated nation now?  How many fatal train accidents are there every day?
Needs to be investigated ....we cannot allow this to happen..whosoever is responsible should be behind bars.
India didn't blame Pakistan for this???
Stop riding on the roof
"Very good English by pooja mehtha at a time when indians are becoming illiterate, and can only speak doodhwala hindi, refreshing to hear English"
"indian trains are always overload, even the roof."
PAKISTAN INVOLVE
"Maybe France, China or Japan can help India building highspeed trains but safer. Pray that no children become orphans because of this."
It is sheer callousness by the railway signal unit.
Not surprised have u guys seen how many people are in those trains ??? Oh my God so sad
Can trains collide in 2023? It's decades behind others
"Oh looks like wion finally stopped living under a rock.
Despite being an Indian channel you people only got the time to cover this large magnitude of news NOW?

Shame on you, this wouldnt have been the case if this had happened in your favourite states like Gujarat, up, Punjab or maharashtra smh"
 RIP 
It's uncivilized to have thousands of people hanging on the side of the door and all over the roof of the train.
Terror angle cannot be ruled out
I think India not ready for high speed train from japan
Ini pasti sabotase china
"If the Colonial Brits were running the trains, it wouldn't happen!"
"In China trains go 650 km/h

This train hit at 100if hit at 650 all people would be dead. But they just dont"
Not at all surprised when India trains are filled all the way to the roof and people are hanging on the wheels even.
LIFE IN MODIS COUNTRY HAS NO VALUE  MAX PRICE  1 TO 2 LAC  AND OUT OF THAT LARGE AMT IS SIPHONED
"Over population,low quantity of life."
""
This is what happens when you have thousands of people clinging on the side
that's why riding on the train roof is illegal in most copuntries
The cartoon from Germany accurately portrait the reality in India. Well done Germany cartoonist.
china will cut siliguri marathis and gujaratis.....................
